# JS Dev Env

This repository provides a sample dev environment to help you get up and running with Node development!

## Getting Started

Once you have the dev environment, run the following command in the VS Code terminal to start the web server. 

```bash
yarn dev
```

Afterwards, you should be able to open localhost:3000 and see your app running!
